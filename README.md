## Design

Project Beta is a web application that is designed to manage an automobile dealership by monitoring the inventory, sales, and services. This application is run in docker with all dependencies. The three microservices use Restful Api in the back end that is used to display and interact with on the front end. Both sales and services possess an Automobile value object which are created and updated through our poller which requests and retrieves Automobile data from the inventory microservice.
